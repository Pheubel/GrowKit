## Why Unity
Unity was chosen for our application development as it is a tool that allows for rapid prototyping of ideas. Both programmersalready had experiencein Unity, so we could easily adjust to it compared to other tools, saving time during the final sprints

## How to get it working
To get it working in the unity editor, simply import all the assets. To export it to an android device, make sure to build it with IL2CPP and mark the architectures you want to target.

## Advice
It is not requiredto use Unity for the end app devlopment, as it can be considdered overkill for the end goal. Once you have a complete picture of your app , I suggest switching to a native solution to increase performance and build size.
